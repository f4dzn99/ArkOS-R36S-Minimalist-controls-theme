# ArkOS R36S Minimalist controls theme (640x480)

:red_circle: [AmberELEC R36S minimalist controls theme](https://github.com/f4dzn99/AmberELEC-R36S-Minimalist-controls-theme) adapted for ArkOS. I designed them in inkscape to be very minimalist, based on the console controls.

There are 8 color options to choose from and they apply to the system wallpaper. :smiley:
